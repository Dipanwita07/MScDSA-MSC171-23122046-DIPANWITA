| 2     | lab_02   | In a quaint little village named Harmonyville, there lived a curious individual named Alex. Alex was known for his passion for collecting names. His dream was to create an extensive list of unique names that would reflect the diversity and camaraderie of the village. Alex used to sit in the village junction; as the villagers passed, Alex eagerly approached them and asked for their names. With each encounter, they diligently recorded the names in his notepad.To keep things organized, You were one among the villagers and have decided to create a program to assist them in this endeavour. You asked Alex to begin by defining a list on his laptop instead of his notepad, and you started writing functions to add names.The function that you have defined should do Whenever a new name is encountered, record it.If an existing name comes, the program says the name exists.Alex makes a lot of mistakes; your program also has to do the necessary validations.The function quits when q is entered as a name and prints all the names in the list, and then he has to call the function.As a data analyst of the village, analyse the names in the list.Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Alex's name collection grew beyond their wildest dreams. The villagers admired their dedication and the beautifully organized list they had created. Alex's program became a legend in Harmonyville, passed down from generation to generation.And so, in the heart of the village, Alex's legacy lived on - a story of names, community, and the power of coding to bring dreams to life.|[lab 02] https://github.com/DASsukanna/MScDSA-MDS171-23122039-Sukanna/blob/main/LAB/Lab%2002.ipynb|
| 3     | lab_03   | In the serene village of Arithmetica, numbers were not just symbols; they were living entities that coexisted in perfect harmony. Each number had a distinct personality, contributing to the village's balance and order. But occasionally, the numbers would come together for a special event called the Harmony Gathering. During the harmony gathering, the event starts with identifying their Five Point Summary or Descriptive Statistics. For the given set of numbers who arrived for the Harmony Gathering today, can you help the people in Arithmetica find their descriptive statistics?[761, 123, 585, 275, 194, 840, 999, 622, 763, 40, 825, 687, 402, 338, 611, 987, 739, 95, 819, 568, 320, 126, 688, 948, 514, 223, 751, 379, 857, 767, 492, 162, 437, 934, 430, 343, 725, 511, 580, 678, 708, 823, 346, 179, 786, 663, 195, 890, 267, 502, 214, 300, 786, 961, 235, 559, 992, 919, 948, 318, 57, 787, 653, 317, 305, 172, 966, 182, 970, 17, 89, 624, 629, 595, 485, 752, 984, 978, 460, 124, 321, 256, 614, 852, 811, 561, 127, 207, 406, 615, 888, 391, 691, 470, 911, 401, 137, 600, 478, 682]The values that Arithmetica is looking at are:Mean Minimum Maximum RangeThe people of Arithmetica have another issue: they don't believe in the built-in functions (sum, len, max, min, sort, etc.) that Python provides. With the help of functions you design, try to convince the people from Arithmetica that both the outputs (the results generated by your custom functions and the functions that Python Provides) are the same.|<a href="lab 03.ipynb">lab 03.ipynb</a>|
| 4     | lab_04   | A Taste of Success: The Restaurant Management System.In the heart of the bustling city of Lavasa was a charming little restaurant named "Culinary Delights." Owned by a passionate chef named Chef Amelia, Culinary Delights was renowned for its mouthwatering dishes, warm ambience, and exceptional customer service.Chef Amelia had always dreamed of running her restaurant since she was a child. Her love for cooking led her to culinary school, where she honed her skills and developed her signature recipes. With hard work and determination, she finally opened Culinary Delights, a cosy place where people could savour her culinary creations.As Culinary Delights gained popularity, it faced a significant challenge – managing orders efficiently. Chef Amelia realised that she needed a robust Restaurant Management System (RMS) to maintain the restaurant's reputation.Chef Amelia would like to hire you as a team lead for the talented software developers Mark, Sarah, and David she already has. Together, you will create an advanced RMS that will revolutionise Culinary Delights.The software Chef Amelia is looking for is straightforward and has to store the orders in a file the restaurant gets from its customers.As a data analyst specialist, gather insights from the orders that Your hotel Culinary Delights received from their customer over time and display it to Chef Amelia as she uses your Software Application.|<a href="lab 04.ipynb">lab 04.ipynb</a>| 
| 5     | lab_05   |Create Lists for [Item, Quantity, Price] with 10 random values of your choice.The item list can be of any category of your choice [Food Items, Grocery Items,...] or anything you choose that can be bought.Prepare a CSV file with combinations of these values with the help of random index & looping statements and other control structures we discussed in class.To get a random index or number to access items from the list, you can use the following:random is a library in Python that can be used to generate random numbers.|<a href="lab 05.ipynb">lab 05.ipynb</a>|
 | 6     | lab_06   |Your CSV file should have a minimum of 100 rows created randomly with the data in the list and the random library.Each row in the CSV file will have (item, Quantity, and UnitPrice).After preparing the CSV with Python code, you need to compute.The total cost for each row, display the result from the first 5 rows and the last 10 rows .Calculate the total cost for each unique item in the dataset.Item Name,Total Quantity,Total .Print the minimum & maximum price for each item sold.|[lAB 06](https://github.com/DASsukanna/MScDSA-MDS171-23122039-Sukanna/blob/main/LAB/lab%2006.ipynb)|
| 7     | lab_07   |In the charming little town named "Culinary Haven", there stood a restaurant called "The Enchanted Fork". This restaurant was more than just a place to eat; it was a magical experience that left a lasting impression on all who visited. The restaurant is also famous for its management application that takes up customer orders.The software collects the order details for the customers. The application generates a unique orderid for each order based on the below specifications. The software system has a predefined menu of items and their prices, from which the user can select them.OrderID is created with the help of a combination of 5 random numbers generated with the help of a random library in Python. You can use random.randint() function to get one random integer at a time and the order id is generated by concatenating five such numbers.Apart from orderid, each order will have the items ordered and their quantity saved.The application has the following options in its menu: Create new order,View Orders (List and calculate the bill for each order),Assumptions:,Each order will have a unique orderID generated as per the specifications given.,Each order can have multiple items.,Once the order is completed, you may calculate,the total order value.You can set a predefined menu and price for the items|<a href="LAB 07.ipynb">LAB 07.ipynb</a>|
